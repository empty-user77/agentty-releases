Agentty is free and needs no account. Download it, drag it in, and start a terminal.

## Download

Every release is published on the [releases page](https://github.com/empty-user77/agentty-releases/releases).

**macOS 13 or later, Apple silicon** — `Agentty-X.Y.Z-…-arm64.dmg`. Open it and drag **Agentty** into **Applications**. The app is signed with a Developer ID and notarized by Apple, so it opens without a warning.

> [!NOTE]
> There is no Intel Mac build: Agentty for macOS is Apple silicon only.

**Windows 10 version 1809 or later, x64** — `Agentty-X.Y.Z-windows-x64-setup.exe`. It installs for your user only and needs no administrator rights.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Windows installer is not code-signed yet**, so Windows SmartScreen may say the publisher is unknown. To continue, choose **More info → Run anyway**. If your browser refuses to download the `.exe` at all — Chrome blocks unsigned executables — take `Agentty-X.Y.Z-windows-x64-setup.zip` instead and unzip it; it holds the same installer.

**Linux, x86_64** — Debian 12+ / Ubuntu 22.04+: `sudo apt install ./Agentty-X.Y.Z-linux-amd64.deb`. RHEL 9+ / Fedora: `sudo dnf install ./Agentty-X.Y.Z-linux-x86_64.rpm`.

Checksums for every file are in `Agentty-X.Y.Z-SHA256SUMS.txt`. What differs between the three is in [Platforms](/docs/platforms).

## Agent command line tools

Agentty runs the agents; it does not bundle them. Install the ones you want and make sure they are on the `PATH` of your login shell:

- **Claude Code** — `claude`
- **Codex** — `codex`
- Optional: Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, Cursor CLI, Grok, OpenCode, Qwen Code, Amp, Droid, Goose, Crush, Aider, and local Ollama models

Agentty detects what you have installed and offers only those. Missing tools stay hidden instead of failing later.

> [!TIP]
> If an agent works in your terminal but not in Agentty, the usual cause is a `PATH` set in an interactive-only shell file. Agentty starts panes through your login shell, so put the `PATH` export where a login shell reads it.

You can also sign in without the CLI's own login — API key, gateway token, `claude setup-token`, Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or an imported Codex `auth.json` — in **Settings → Accounts**.

### Node.js

Plugins written in JavaScript need **Node.js 18 or newer** on your `PATH`. Agentty itself does not require it.

### Git

The git page, working trees and branch switching use the `git` on your `PATH`. On Windows, Claude Code's hooks need **Git for Windows**.

## Updating

Agentty checks for new versions at launch and hourly.

- **macOS and Windows** — Agentty downloads the update, checks it against the release checksums, installs it and relaunches.
- **Linux** — Agentty tells you a new version is out and links to the release page; install the new `.deb` or `.rpm` with your package manager.

## Building from source

The source repository is not public yet. Opening it is planned; until then, the builds on the releases page are the way to run Agentty.

## Where Agentty keeps its files

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.agentty/settings.json` | Preferences |
| `~/.agentty/workspaces.json` | Workspaces, tabs, splits and groups |
| `~/.agentty/plugins/` | Installed plugins |
| `~/.agentty/handoffs/` | Context documents from Session Flow and migrations |
| `~/.agentty/connectors.json` | API connector definitions (secrets live in the OS credential store) |

The full list is in the [configuration reference](/docs/configuration-reference).

## Uninstalling

- **macOS** — delete `Agentty.app` from Applications.
- **Windows** — Settings → Apps → Agentty → Uninstall.
- **Linux** — `sudo apt remove agentty` or `sudo dnf remove agentty`.

To remove your data as well, delete `~/.agentty`. Sessions written by the agent CLIs live in their own folders (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`) and are not Agentty's to remove.
